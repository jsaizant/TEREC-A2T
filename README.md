# TEREC-A2T: Temporal Relation classification in the Clinical domain with the Ask2Transformers framework.
This repository contains the code for the zero-shot evaluation of textual entailment models on temporal relation classification in the clinical domain. The textual entailment models are from the [Ask2Transformers framework](https://github.com/osainz59/Ask2Transformers) (Sainz, 2021b) and the code is based on the work from Sainz et al. (2021b).
