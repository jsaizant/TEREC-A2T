### Temporal Relation classification in the Clinical domain with the Ask2Transformers framework.
  
This repository contains the code for our zero-shot evaluation of textual entailment models on temporal relation classification in clinical domain documents. 

The textual entailment models are from the [Ask2Transformers framework](https://github.com/osainz59/Ask2Transformers) (Sainz, 2021b) and the code is based on the work from Sainz et al. (2021b). The corpus was retrieved from the [i2b2 2012 Temporal Relations Task](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) (Sun, 2013).

## Paper poster 

This poster was presented at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/ EHU) as a final project for the Language Analysis and Processing Master's degree.
